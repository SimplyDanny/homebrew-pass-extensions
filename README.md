# Homebrew pass extensions

Formulae for the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager providing extensions for [pass](https://passwordstore.org)

## How to use it

With a Homebrew installation set up just type

    brew tap simplydanny/pass-extensions

and then

    brew install pass-<extension-name>

to install an extension. If you do not have pass already installed it will do that for you, too.
